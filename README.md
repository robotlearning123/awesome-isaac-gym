## GTC

- [Sim-to-Real in Isaac Sim](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s31824/)

Learn how to train and test robots in virtual environments with Isaac Sim on Omniverse, then transfer to physical Jetson powered robots.

- [Isaac Gym: End-to-End GPU-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s32037/)

Isaac Gym is NVIDIA’s environment for high-performance reinforcement learning on GPUs. We will review key API features, demonstrate examples of training agents, and provide updates on future integration of Isaac Gym functionality within the NVIDIA Omniverse platform. We will demonstrate how to create environments with thousands of agents to train in parallel, and how the Isaac Gym system allows developers to create tensor based views of physics state for all environments. We will also demonstrate the application of physics based domain randomization in Isaac Gym, which can help with sim2real transfer of learned policies to physical robots.

- [Bridging Sim2Real Gap: Simulation Tuning for Training Deep Learning Robotic Perception Models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s31649/)

Deep neural networks enable accurate perception for robots. Simulation offers a way to train deep learning robotic perception models that were previously not possible in scenarios where it is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, or infeasible to collect large labeled datasets. We’ll dive into how NVIDIA is bridging the gap between simulation and reality with domain randomization, photorealistic simulation, and accurate physics imitation with Isaac Sim, and more.
